         <p>The proposed problem involved the “Optimization of the interaction and transmission of events held at the factory together with the operators, also allowing the participation of guests online”.

          Therefore, our solution based on this objective was to devise and discuss possible solutions aimed at practicality and agility in the preparation of online and face-to-face meetings simultaneously.
          
          That's why the “Bosch Stream Rover” was designed to generate easy access to such meetings. It is a mobile workbench, which groups together all the components and resources necessary for its application.</p>

         <p>A workbench was built with aluminum profiles 45x45mm, and its structure composed of 5mm PVC plates. As it is mobile, it uses four castors, two of which are lockable for safe handling. In addition, there is a lockable acrylic door to safely store all components.

          Therefore, inside there is a sound box in its own space, so that there are no unwanted movements and its wiring is also well behaved. In the upper internal part, a compartment was built where other devices were allocated, such as the microphone receiver and the dynamic microphones, in addition to a portable Bluetooth microphone, with enough space and foam supports so that they do not move in the drawer.
          
          Still present on the shelf, we made a support to allocate a power strip long of approximately five meters, to connect and support all uses of sockets, such as the sound box (which does not have its own battery), the microphone receiver, and for charging , both from the portable microphone and from the notebook.</p>
